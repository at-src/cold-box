# Azure Activity Logs For Threats (cold-box)

> **Journal ID:** `CB-SKL-134` — cite this in every journal entry while following this playbook.

## Cold-box constraints (always)

- Evidence lives on the **sealed operation table** — read only through the viewport (`input_relpath`).
- **Never write** on `operation-table/`; tool output goes to `records/{case_id}/scratch/`.
- **Log this playbook** in the case journal with **`CB-SKL-134`** (`log_skill`) when you adopt it and at each major step.
- Every SIFT execution: `run_sift_tool` with **`purpose`**, **`why`**, and cite returned **`tool_id`** + **`audit_id`** in the journal.
- Prefer `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` — skip `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Load this playbook with `get_skill("cb-azure-activity-logs-for-threats")`; do not treat markdown code blocks as direct shell commands.

## Agent loop

1. `suggest_skills(case_profile=...)` or `get_skill("cb-azure-activity-logs-for-threats")` → note **`CB-SKL-134`**
2. `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="CB-SKL-134", action="adopted", note="...")`
3. `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` → pick tools from the map below
4. `describe_sift_tool(tool_id)` → `run_sift_tool(...)` → journal stdout with `CB-SKL-134` + `audit_id`
5. `log_skill(..., action="finding", note="...")` when recording conclusions; self-correct if outputs conflict


## When to use

- When investigating security incidents that require analyzing azure activity logs for threats
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Tool map (SIFT via MCP)

**Execution mode:** `reference` — procedure steps target external platforms (SIEM, cloud, etc.).
Use for investigation guidance; log `{journal_id}` and note gaps when SIFT cannot run a step.

## Cold-box MCP examples

Use these instead of running shell blocks directly. Always log `{journal_id}` in purpose/why or via `log_skill`.

_No SIFT tools mapped for this playbook on cold-box._
Follow the procedure for reasoning; document external-platform gaps in the journal.

## Journal logging

When you adopt this playbook, append to `records/{case_id}/{case_id}.md`:

```markdown
## {timestamp} — skill `CB-SKL-134` (`cb-azure-activity-logs-for-threats`)

- **action:** adopted | step | finding | deferred | completed
- **note:** What you did or concluded under this playbook
- **related_audit_ids:** (optional) CB-… from run_sift_tool
```

Or call MCP: `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="{journal_id}", action="adopted", note="...")`

## Cold-box path translation

When the procedure below uses host paths, translate as follows:

| Procedure path | Cold-box equivalent |
|----------------|---------------------|
| `C:\Evidence\...` / `/cases/...` | `{input_relpath}` on the sealed table (via viewport) |
| `C:\Output\...` / `/analysis/...` | `records/{case_id}/scratch/` (tool stdout/files) |
| Live SIEM / cloud console steps | **Reference only** on cold-box — note capability gap in journal |

Do not copy evidence off the table except into `records/{case_id}/scratch/` via `run_sift_tool`.


## Procedure

## When to Use

- When investigating security incidents that require analyzing azure activity logs for threats
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with security operations concepts and tools
- Access to a test or lab environment for safe execution
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies installed
- Appropriate authorization for any testing activities

## Instructions

Use azure-monitor-query to execute KQL queries against Azure Log Analytics workspaces,
detecting suspicious admin operations and sign-in anomalies.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.monitor.query import LogsQueryClient
from datetime import timedelta

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = LogsQueryClient(credential)

response = client.query_workspace(
    workspace_id="WORKSPACE_ID",
    query="AzureActivity | where OperationNameValue has 'MICROSOFT.AUTHORIZATION/ROLEASSIGNMENTS/WRITE' | take 10",
    timespan=timedelta(hours=24),
)
```

Key detection queries:
1. Role assignment changes (privilege escalation)
2. Resource group and subscription modifications
3. Key vault secret access from new IPs
4. Network security group rule changes
5. Conditional access policy modifications

## Examples

```python
# Detect new Global Admin role assignments
query = '''
AuditLogs
| where OperationName == "Add member to role"
| where TargetResources[0].modifiedProperties[0].newValue has "Global Administrator"
'''
```

## Self-correction

- If a SIFT tool errors, read `describe_sift_tool` and pick an alternate from the tool map.
- If procedure steps require SIEM/cloud/live APIs, log `{journal_id}` + `action=deferred` with the gap.
- Do not override `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Mark inference vs confirmed in journal; tie confirmed findings to `audit_id`.

## Limits

- Playbooks guide reasoning; **confirmed findings require tool output** in scratch with matching `audit_id`.
- Reference-mode steps are not executable on cold-box until equivalent SIFT tooling exists.
