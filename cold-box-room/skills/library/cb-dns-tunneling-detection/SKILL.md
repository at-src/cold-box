# Dns Tunneling Detection (cold-box)

> **Journal ID:** `CB-SKL-213` — cite this in every journal entry while following this playbook.

## Cold-box constraints (always)

- Evidence lives on the **sealed operation table** — read only through the viewport (`input_relpath`).
- **Never write** on `operation-table/`; tool output goes to `records/{case_id}/scratch/`.
- **Log this playbook** in the case journal with **`CB-SKL-213`** (`log_skill`) when you adopt it and at each major step.
- Every SIFT execution: `run_sift_tool` with **`purpose`**, **`why`**, and cite returned **`tool_id`** + **`audit_id`** in the journal.
- Prefer `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` — skip `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Load this playbook with `get_skill("cb-dns-tunneling-detection")`; do not treat markdown code blocks as direct shell commands.

## Agent loop

1. `suggest_skills(case_profile=...)` or `get_skill("cb-dns-tunneling-detection")` → note **`CB-SKL-213`**
2. `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="CB-SKL-213", action="adopted", note="...")`
3. `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` → pick tools from the map below
4. `describe_sift_tool(tool_id)` → `run_sift_tool(...)` → journal stdout with `CB-SKL-213` + `audit_id`
5. `log_skill(..., action="finding", note="...")` when recording conclusions; self-correct if outputs conflict


## When to use

- When conducting security assessments that involve performing dns tunneling detection
- When following incident response procedures for related security events
- When performing scheduled security testing or auditing activities
- When validating security controls through hands-on testing

## Tool map (SIFT via MCP)

**Execution mode:** `reference` — procedure steps target external platforms (SIEM, cloud, etc.).
Use for investigation guidance; log `{journal_id}` and note gaps when SIFT cannot run a step.

## Cold-box MCP examples

Use these instead of running shell blocks directly. Always log `{journal_id}` in purpose/why or via `log_skill`.

_No SIFT tools mapped for this playbook on cold-box._
Follow the procedure for reasoning; document external-platform gaps in the journal.

## Journal logging

When you adopt this playbook, append to `records/{case_id}/{case_id}.md`:

```markdown
## {timestamp} — skill `CB-SKL-213` (`cb-dns-tunneling-detection`)

- **action:** adopted | step | finding | deferred | completed
- **note:** What you did or concluded under this playbook
- **related_audit_ids:** (optional) CB-… from run_sift_tool
```

Or call MCP: `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="{journal_id}", action="adopted", note="...")`

## Cold-box path translation

When the procedure below uses host paths, translate as follows:

| Procedure path | Cold-box equivalent |
|----------------|---------------------|
| `C:\Evidence\...` / `/cases/...` | `{input_relpath}` on the sealed table (via viewport) |
| `C:\Output\...` / `/analysis/...` | `records/{case_id}/scratch/` (tool stdout/files) |
| Live SIEM / cloud console steps | **Reference only** on cold-box — note capability gap in journal |

Do not copy evidence off the table except into `records/{case_id}/scratch/` via `run_sift_tool`.


## Procedure

## When to Use

- When conducting security assessments that involve performing dns tunneling detection
- When following incident response procedures for related security events
- When performing scheduled security testing or auditing activities
- When validating security controls through hands-on testing

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with security operations concepts and tools
- Access to a test or lab environment for safe execution
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies installed
- Appropriate authorization for any testing activities

## Instructions

Analyze DNS traffic for indicators of DNS tunneling using entropy analysis and
statistical methods on query name characteristics.

```python
import math
from collections import Counter

def shannon_entropy(data):
    if not data:
        return 0
    counter = Counter(data)
    length = len(data)
    return -sum((c/length) * math.log2(c/length) for c in counter.values())

# Legitimate domain: low entropy (~3.0-3.5)
print(shannon_entropy("www.google.com"))
# DNS tunnel: high entropy (~4.0-5.0)
print(shannon_entropy("aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ.tunnel.example.com"))
```

Key detection indicators:
1. High Shannon entropy in query names (> 3.5 for subdomain labels)
2. Unusually long query names (> 50 characters)
3. High volume of TXT record requests to a single domain
4. High unique subdomain count per parent domain
5. Non-standard character distribution in labels

## Examples

```python
from scapy.all import rdpcap, DNS, DNSQR
packets = rdpcap("dns_traffic.pcap")
for pkt in packets:
    if pkt.haslayer(DNSQR):
        query = pkt[DNSQR].qname.decode()
        entropy = shannon_entropy(query)
        if entropy > 4.0:
            print(f"Suspicious: {query} (entropy={entropy:.2f})")
```

## Self-correction

- If a SIFT tool errors, read `describe_sift_tool` and pick an alternate from the tool map.
- If procedure steps require SIEM/cloud/live APIs, log `{journal_id}` + `action=deferred` with the gap.
- Do not override `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Mark inference vs confirmed in journal; tie confirmed findings to `audit_id`.

## Limits

- Playbooks guide reasoning; **confirmed findings require tool output** in scratch with matching `audit_id`.
- Reference-mode steps are not executable on cold-box until equivalent SIFT tooling exists.
