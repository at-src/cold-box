# Hunting For Suspicious Scheduled Tasks (cold-box)

> **Journal ID:** `CB-SKL-247` — cite this in every journal entry while following this playbook.

## Cold-box constraints (always)

- Evidence lives on the **sealed operation table** — read only through the viewport (`input_relpath`).
- **Never write** on `operation-table/`; tool output goes to `records/{case_id}/scratch/`.
- **Log this playbook** in the case journal with **`CB-SKL-247`** (`log_skill`) when you adopt it and at each major step.
- Every SIFT execution: `run_sift_tool` with **`purpose`**, **`why`**, and cite returned **`tool_id`** + **`audit_id`** in the journal.
- Prefer `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` — skip `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Load this playbook with `get_skill("cb-hunting-for-suspicious-scheduled-tasks")`; do not treat markdown code blocks as direct shell commands.

## Agent loop

1. `suggest_skills(case_profile=...)` or `get_skill("cb-hunting-for-suspicious-scheduled-tasks")` → note **`CB-SKL-247`**
2. `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="CB-SKL-247", action="adopted", note="...")`
3. `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` → pick tools from the map below
4. `describe_sift_tool(tool_id)` → `run_sift_tool(...)` → journal stdout with `CB-SKL-247` + `audit_id`
5. `log_skill(..., action="finding", note="...")` when recording conclusions; self-correct if outputs conflict


## When to use

- When proactively hunting for persistence mechanisms in Windows environments
- After detecting schtasks.exe or at.exe usage in process creation logs
- When investigating malware that survives reboots and user logoffs
- During incident response to enumerate all persistence on compromised systems
- When Windows Security Event ID 4698 (Scheduled Task Created) fires for unusual tasks

## Tool map (SIFT via MCP)

**Execution mode:** `sift_runnable` — SIFT tools below are available on this host.

| binary | tool_id | verified | available |
|--------|---------|----------|-----------|
| `powershell` | `SIFT-179` | no | no |
| `regsvr32` | `SIFT-100` | no | yes |
| `diff` | `SIFT-007` | yes | yes |

## Cold-box MCP examples

Use these instead of running shell blocks directly. Always log `{journal_id}` in purpose/why or via `log_skill`.

### `powershell` → `SIFT-179`

```json
{
  "tool_id": "SIFT-179",
  "case_id": "{case_id}",
  "input_relpath": "{artifact_relpath}",
  "purpose": "[CB-SKL-247] powershell per playbook step",
  "why": "Executing cb-hunting-for-suspicious-scheduled-tasks \u2014 see Procedure section",
  "extra_args": []
}
```

### `regsvr32` → `SIFT-100`

```json
{
  "tool_id": "SIFT-100",
  "case_id": "{case_id}",
  "input_relpath": "{artifact_relpath}",
  "purpose": "[CB-SKL-247] regsvr32 per playbook step",
  "why": "Executing cb-hunting-for-suspicious-scheduled-tasks \u2014 see Procedure section",
  "extra_args": []
}
```

### `diff` → `SIFT-007`

```json
{
  "tool_id": "SIFT-007",
  "case_id": "{case_id}",
  "input_relpath": "{artifact_relpath}",
  "purpose": "[CB-SKL-247] diff per playbook step",
  "why": "Executing cb-hunting-for-suspicious-scheduled-tasks \u2014 see Procedure section",
  "extra_args": []
}
```

## Journal logging

When you adopt this playbook, append to `records/{case_id}/{case_id}.md`:

```markdown
## {timestamp} — skill `CB-SKL-247` (`cb-hunting-for-suspicious-scheduled-tasks`)

- **action:** adopted | step | finding | deferred | completed
- **note:** What you did or concluded under this playbook
- **related_audit_ids:** (optional) CB-… from run_sift_tool
```

Or call MCP: `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="{journal_id}", action="adopted", note="...")`

## Cold-box path translation

When the procedure below uses host paths, translate as follows:

| Procedure path | Cold-box equivalent |
|----------------|---------------------|
| `C:\Evidence\...` / `/cases/...` | `{input_relpath}` on the sealed table (via viewport) |
| `C:\Output\...` / `/analysis/...` | `records/{case_id}/scratch/` (tool stdout/files) |
| Live SIEM / cloud console steps | **Reference only** on cold-box — note capability gap in journal |

Do not copy evidence off the table except into `records/{case_id}/scratch/` via `run_sift_tool`.


## Procedure

## When to Use

- When proactively hunting for persistence mechanisms in Windows environments
- After detecting schtasks.exe or at.exe usage in process creation logs
- When investigating malware that survives reboots and user logoffs
- During incident response to enumerate all persistence on compromised systems
- When Windows Security Event ID 4698 (Scheduled Task Created) fires for unusual tasks

## Prerequisites

- Windows Security Event ID 4698/4699/4702 (Task Created/Deleted/Updated)
- Sysmon Event ID 1 for schtasks.exe process creation with command lines
- Windows Task Scheduler operational log (Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational)
- PowerShell logging for Register-ScheduledTask cmdlet usage
- Access to Task Scheduler XML definitions on endpoints

## Workflow

1. **Enumerate All Scheduled Tasks**: Collect complete task inventory from target systems using `schtasks /query /fo CSV /v` or `Get-ScheduledTask` PowerShell cmdlet.
2. **Monitor Task Creation Events**: Track Event ID 4698 for new task creation, correlating with the creating process and user account context.
3. **Analyze Task Actions**: Examine what each task executes. Flag tasks running scripts (PowerShell, cmd, wscript), binaries from user-writable paths (TEMP, AppData, Downloads), or encoded/obfuscated commands.
4. **Check Task Triggers**: Review trigger conditions. Tasks triggered by system startup, user logon, or short intervals (1-5 minutes) warrant investigation.
5. **Identify Hidden or Disguised Tasks**: Hunt for tasks with names mimicking legitimate Windows tasks, tasks with Security Descriptor modifications hiding them from standard enumeration, or tasks stored in non-standard registry locations.
6. **Correlate with Process Execution**: Match scheduled task execution events with process creation logs to confirm what actually runs.
7. **Baseline and Diff**: Compare current task inventory against known-good baselines to identify new, modified, or unexpected tasks.

## Detection Queries

### Splunk -- Scheduled Task Creation
```spl
index=wineventlog EventCode=4698
| spath output=TaskName path=EventData.TaskName
| spath output=TaskContent path=EventData.TaskContent
| where NOT match(TaskName, "(?i)(\\\\Microsoft\\\\|\\\\Windows\\\\)")
| table _time Computer SubjectUserName TaskName TaskContent
```

### Splunk -- Schtasks.exe Suspicious Usage
```spl
index=sysmon EventCode=1 Image="*\\schtasks.exe"
| where match(CommandLine, "(?i)/create")
| where match(CommandLine, "(?i)(powershell|cmd|wscript|cscript|mshta|rundll32|regsvr32|http|https|\\\\temp\\\\|\\\\appdata\\\\)")
| table _time Computer User CommandLine ParentImage
```

### KQL -- Microsoft Sentinel
```kql
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4698
| extend TaskName = tostring(EventData.TaskName)
| extend TaskContent = tostring(EventData.TaskContent)
| where TaskContent has_any ("powershell", "cmd.exe", "wscript", "http://", "https://", "\\Temp\\", "\\AppData\\")
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, Account, TaskName, TaskContent
```

## Common Scenarios

1. **Cobalt Strike Persistence**: Creates scheduled tasks via schtasks.exe to execute PowerShell download cradles at user logon intervals.
2. **Ransomware Staging**: Task created to run encryption payload at a future time, often during off-hours for maximum impact.
3. **Hidden Task via SD Modification**: Attacker modifies Security Descriptor of scheduled task to hide it from normal enumeration while maintaining execution.
4. **COM Handler Abuse**: Task uses COM handler rather than direct executable path, making action inspection more complex.
5. **Lateral Movement via Tasks**: Remote scheduled task creation using `schtasks /create /s REMOTE_HOST` for execution on other systems.

## Output Format

```
Hunt ID: TH-SCHTASK-[DATE]-[SEQ]
Host: [Hostname]
Task Name: [Full task path]
Action: [Command/Script executed]
Trigger: [Startup/Logon/Timer/Event]
Created By: [User account]
Created From: [Local/Remote]
Creation Time: [Timestamp]
Run As: [Execution account]
Risk Level: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
```

## Self-correction

- If a SIFT tool errors, read `describe_sift_tool` and pick an alternate from the tool map.
- If procedure steps require SIEM/cloud/live APIs, log `{journal_id}` + `action=deferred` with the gap.
- Do not override `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Mark inference vs confirmed in journal; tie confirmed findings to `audit_id`.

## Limits

- Playbooks guide reasoning; **confirmed findings require tool output** in scratch with matching `audit_id`.
- Reference-mode steps are not executable on cold-box until equivalent SIFT tooling exists.
