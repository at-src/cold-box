# Persistence Mechanisms In Linux (cold-box)

> **Journal ID:** `CB-SKL-309` — cite this in every journal entry while following this playbook.

## Cold-box constraints (always)

- Evidence lives on the **sealed operation table** — read only through the viewport (`input_relpath`).
- **Never write** on `operation-table/`; tool output goes to `records/{case_id}/scratch/`.
- **Log this playbook** in the case journal with **`CB-SKL-309`** (`log_skill`) when you adopt it and at each major step.
- Every SIFT execution: `run_sift_tool` with **`purpose`**, **`why`**, and cite returned **`tool_id`** + **`audit_id`** in the journal.
- Prefer `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` — skip `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Load this playbook with `get_skill("cb-persistence-mechanisms-in-linux")`; do not treat markdown code blocks as direct shell commands.

## Agent loop

1. `suggest_skills(case_profile=...)` or `get_skill("cb-persistence-mechanisms-in-linux")` → note **`CB-SKL-309`**
2. `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="CB-SKL-309", action="adopted", note="...")`
3. `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` → pick tools from the map below
4. `describe_sift_tool(tool_id)` → `run_sift_tool(...)` → journal stdout with `CB-SKL-309` + `audit_id`
5. `log_skill(..., action="finding", note="...")` when recording conclusions; self-correct if outputs conflict


## When to use

- When investigating security incidents that require analyzing persistence mechanisms in linux
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Tool map (SIFT via MCP)

**Execution mode:** `sift_runnable` — SIFT tools below are available on this host.

| binary | tool_id | verified | available |
|--------|---------|----------|-----------|
| `file` | `SIFT-008` | yes | yes |

## Cold-box MCP examples

Use these instead of running shell blocks directly. Always log `{journal_id}` in purpose/why or via `log_skill`.

### `file` → `SIFT-008`

```json
{
  "tool_id": "SIFT-008",
  "case_id": "{case_id}",
  "input_relpath": "{artifact_relpath}",
  "purpose": "[CB-SKL-309] file per playbook step",
  "why": "Executing cb-persistence-mechanisms-in-linux \u2014 see Procedure section",
  "extra_args": []
}
```

## Journal logging

When you adopt this playbook, append to `records/{case_id}/{case_id}.md`:

```markdown
## {timestamp} — skill `CB-SKL-309` (`cb-persistence-mechanisms-in-linux`)

- **action:** adopted | step | finding | deferred | completed
- **note:** What you did or concluded under this playbook
- **related_audit_ids:** (optional) CB-… from run_sift_tool
```

Or call MCP: `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="{journal_id}", action="adopted", note="...")`

## Cold-box path translation

When the procedure below uses host paths, translate as follows:

| Procedure path | Cold-box equivalent |
|----------------|---------------------|
| `C:\Evidence\...` / `/cases/...` | `{input_relpath}` on the sealed table (via viewport) |
| `C:\Output\...` / `/analysis/...` | `records/{case_id}/scratch/` (tool stdout/files) |
| Live SIEM / cloud console steps | **Reference only** on cold-box — note capability gap in journal |

Do not copy evidence off the table except into `records/{case_id}/scratch/` via `run_sift_tool`.


## Procedure

## Overview

Adversaries establish persistence on Linux systems through crontab jobs, systemd service/timer units, LD_PRELOAD library injection, shell profile modifications (.bashrc, .profile), SSH authorized_keys backdoors, and init script manipulation. This skill scans for all known persistence vectors, checks file timestamps and integrity, and correlates findings with auditd logs to build a timeline of persistence installation.


## When to Use

- When investigating security incidents that require analyzing persistence mechanisms in linux
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Prerequisites

- Root or sudo access on target Linux system (or forensic image)
- auditd configured with file watch rules on persistence paths
- Python 3.8+ with standard library (os, subprocess, json)
- Optional: OSSEC/Wazuh agent for file integrity monitoring alerts

## Steps

1. **Scan Crontab Entries** — Enumerate all user crontabs, /etc/cron.d/, /etc/cron.daily/, and anacron jobs for suspicious commands
2. **Audit Systemd Units** — Check /etc/systemd/system/ and ~/.config/systemd/user/ for non-package-managed service and timer units
3. **Detect LD_PRELOAD Hijacking** — Check /etc/ld.so.preload and LD_PRELOAD environment variable for injected shared libraries
4. **Inspect Shell Profiles** — Scan .bashrc, .bash_profile, .profile, /etc/profile.d/ for injected commands or reverse shells
5. **Check SSH Authorized Keys** — Audit all authorized_keys files for unauthorized public keys with command restrictions
6. **Correlate Auditd Logs** — Search auditd logs for file modification events on persistence paths to build an installation timeline
7. **Generate Persistence Report** — Produce a risk-scored report of all discovered persistence mechanisms

## Expected Output

- JSON report of all persistence mechanisms found with risk scores
- Timeline of persistence installation from auditd correlation
- MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping (T1053, T1543, T1574, T1546)
- Remediation commands for each detected persistence mechanism

## Self-correction

- If a SIFT tool errors, read `describe_sift_tool` and pick an alternate from the tool map.
- If procedure steps require SIEM/cloud/live APIs, log `{journal_id}` + `action=deferred` with the gap.
- Do not override `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Mark inference vs confirmed in journal; tie confirmed findings to `audit_id`.

## Limits

- Playbooks guide reasoning; **confirmed findings require tool output** in scratch with matching `audit_id`.
- Reference-mode steps are not executable on cold-box until equivalent SIFT tooling exists.
