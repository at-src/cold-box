# Detecting Malicious Scheduled Tasks With Sysmon (cold-box)

> **Journal ID:** `CB-SKL-026` — cite this in every journal entry while following this playbook.

## Cold-box constraints (always)

- Evidence lives on the **sealed operation table** — read only through the viewport (`input_relpath`).
- **Never write** on `operation-table/`; tool output goes to `records/{case_id}/scratch/`.
- **Log this playbook** in the case journal with **`CB-SKL-026`** (`log_skill`) when you adopt it and at each major step.
- Every SIFT execution: `run_sift_tool` with **`purpose`**, **`why`**, and cite returned **`tool_id`** + **`audit_id`** in the journal.
- Prefer `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` — skip `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Load this playbook with `get_skill("cb-detecting-malicious-scheduled-tasks-with-sysmon")`; do not treat markdown code blocks as direct shell commands.

## Agent loop

1. `suggest_skills(case_profile=...)` or `get_skill("cb-detecting-malicious-scheduled-tasks-with-sysmon")` → note **`CB-SKL-026`**
2. `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="CB-SKL-026", action="adopted", note="...")`
3. `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` → pick tools from the map below
4. `describe_sift_tool(tool_id)` → `run_sift_tool(...)` → journal stdout with `CB-SKL-026` + `audit_id`
5. `log_skill(..., action="finding", note="...")` when recording conclusions; self-correct if outputs conflict


## When to use

- When investigating security incidents that require detecting malicious scheduled tasks with sysmon
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Tool map (SIFT via MCP)

**Execution mode:** `sift_runnable` — SIFT tools below are available on this host.

| binary | tool_id | verified | available |
|--------|---------|----------|-----------|
| `powershell` | `SIFT-179` | no | no |
| `file` | `SIFT-008` | yes | yes |

## Cold-box MCP examples

Use these instead of running shell blocks directly. Always log `{journal_id}` in purpose/why or via `log_skill`.

### `powershell` → `SIFT-179`

```json
{
  "tool_id": "SIFT-179",
  "case_id": "{case_id}",
  "input_relpath": "{artifact_relpath}",
  "purpose": "[CB-SKL-026] powershell per playbook step",
  "why": "Executing cb-detecting-malicious-scheduled-tasks-with-sysmon \u2014 see Procedure section",
  "extra_args": []
}
```

### `file` → `SIFT-008`

```json
{
  "tool_id": "SIFT-008",
  "case_id": "{case_id}",
  "input_relpath": "{artifact_relpath}",
  "purpose": "[CB-SKL-026] file per playbook step",
  "why": "Executing cb-detecting-malicious-scheduled-tasks-with-sysmon \u2014 see Procedure section",
  "extra_args": []
}
```

## Journal logging

When you adopt this playbook, append to `records/{case_id}/{case_id}.md`:

```markdown
## {timestamp} — skill `CB-SKL-026` (`cb-detecting-malicious-scheduled-tasks-with-sysmon`)

- **action:** adopted | step | finding | deferred | completed
- **note:** What you did or concluded under this playbook
- **related_audit_ids:** (optional) CB-… from run_sift_tool
```

Or call MCP: `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="{journal_id}", action="adopted", note="...")`

## Cold-box path translation

When the procedure below uses host paths, translate as follows:

| Procedure path | Cold-box equivalent |
|----------------|---------------------|
| `C:\Evidence\...` / `/cases/...` | `{input_relpath}` on the sealed table (via viewport) |
| `C:\Output\...` / `/analysis/...` | `records/{case_id}/scratch/` (tool stdout/files) |
| Live SIEM / cloud console steps | **Reference only** on cold-box — note capability gap in journal |

Do not copy evidence off the table except into `records/{case_id}/scratch/` via `run_sift_tool`.


## Procedure

## Overview

Adversaries abuse Windows Task Scheduler (schtasks.exe, at.exe) for persistence (T1053.005)
and lateral movement. Sysmon Event ID 1 captures schtasks.exe process creation with full
command-line arguments, while Event ID 11 captures task XML files written to
C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\. Windows Security Event 4698 logs task registration details.
This skill covers building detection rules that correlate these events to identify
malicious scheduled tasks created from suspicious paths, with encoded payloads, or
targeting remote systems.


## When to Use

- When investigating security incidents that require detecting malicious scheduled tasks with sysmon
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Prerequisites

- Sysmon installed with a detection-focused configuration (e.g., SwiftOnSecurity or Olaf Hartong)
- Windows Event Log forwarding to SIEM (Splunk, Elastic, or Sentinel)
- PowerShell ScriptBlock Logging enabled (Event 4104)

## Steps

1. Configure Sysmon to log Event IDs 1, 11, 12, 13 with task-related filters
2. Build detection rules for schtasks.exe /create with suspicious arguments
3. Correlate Event 4698 (task registered) with Sysmon Event 1 (process create)
4. Hunt for tasks executing from public directories or with encoded commands
5. Alert on remote task creation (schtasks /s) for lateral movement detection

## Expected Output

```
[CRITICAL] Suspicious Scheduled Task Detected
  Task: \Microsoft\Windows\UpdateCheck
  Command: powershell.exe -enc SQBuAHYAbwBrAGUALQBXAGUAYgBSAGU...
  Created By: DOMAIN\compromised_user
  Parent Process: cmd.exe (PID 4532)
  Source: \\192.168.1.50 (remote creation)
  MITRE: T1053.005 - Scheduled Task/Job
```

## Self-correction

- If a SIFT tool errors, read `describe_sift_tool` and pick an alternate from the tool map.
- If procedure steps require SIEM/cloud/live APIs, log `{journal_id}` + `action=deferred` with the gap.
- Do not override `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Mark inference vs confirmed in journal; tie confirmed findings to `audit_id`.

## Limits

- Playbooks guide reasoning; **confirmed findings require tool output** in scratch with matching `audit_id`.
- Reference-mode steps are not executable on cold-box until equivalent SIFT tooling exists.
