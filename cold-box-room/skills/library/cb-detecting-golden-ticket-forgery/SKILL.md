# Detecting Golden Ticket Forgery (cold-box)

> **Journal ID:** `CB-SKL-189` — cite this in every journal entry while following this playbook.

## Cold-box constraints (always)

- Evidence lives on the **sealed operation table** — read only through the viewport (`input_relpath`).
- **Never write** on `operation-table/`; tool output goes to `records/{case_id}/scratch/`.
- **Log this playbook** in the case journal with **`CB-SKL-189`** (`log_skill`) when you adopt it and at each major step.
- Every SIFT execution: `run_sift_tool` with **`purpose`**, **`why`**, and cite returned **`tool_id`** + **`audit_id`** in the journal.
- Prefer `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` — skip `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Load this playbook with `get_skill("cb-detecting-golden-ticket-forgery")`; do not treat markdown code blocks as direct shell commands.

## Agent loop

1. `suggest_skills(case_profile=...)` or `get_skill("cb-detecting-golden-ticket-forgery")` → note **`CB-SKL-189`**
2. `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="CB-SKL-189", action="adopted", note="...")`
3. `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` → pick tools from the map below
4. `describe_sift_tool(tool_id)` → `run_sift_tool(...)` → journal stdout with `CB-SKL-189` + `audit_id`
5. `log_skill(..., action="finding", note="...")` when recording conclusions; self-correct if outputs conflict


## When to use

- When investigating security incidents that require detecting golden ticket forgery
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Tool map (SIFT via MCP)

**Execution mode:** `reference` — procedure steps target external platforms (SIEM, cloud, etc.).
Use for investigation guidance; log `{journal_id}` and note gaps when SIFT cannot run a step.

## Cold-box MCP examples

Use these instead of running shell blocks directly. Always log `{journal_id}` in purpose/why or via `log_skill`.

_No SIFT tools mapped for this playbook on cold-box._
Follow the procedure for reasoning; document external-platform gaps in the journal.

## Journal logging

When you adopt this playbook, append to `records/{case_id}/{case_id}.md`:

```markdown
## {timestamp} — skill `CB-SKL-189` (`cb-detecting-golden-ticket-forgery`)

- **action:** adopted | step | finding | deferred | completed
- **note:** What you did or concluded under this playbook
- **related_audit_ids:** (optional) CB-… from run_sift_tool
```

Or call MCP: `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="{journal_id}", action="adopted", note="...")`

## Cold-box path translation

When the procedure below uses host paths, translate as follows:

| Procedure path | Cold-box equivalent |
|----------------|---------------------|
| `C:\Evidence\...` / `/cases/...` | `{input_relpath}` on the sealed table (via viewport) |
| `C:\Output\...` / `/analysis/...` | `records/{case_id}/scratch/` (tool stdout/files) |
| Live SIEM / cloud console steps | **Reference only** on cold-box — note capability gap in journal |

Do not copy evidence off the table except into `records/{case_id}/scratch/` via `run_sift_tool`.


## Procedure

## Overview

A Golden Ticket attack (MITRE ATT&CK T1558.001) involves forging a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) using the krbtgt account NTLM hash, granting unrestricted access to any service in the Active Directory domain. This skill detects Golden Ticket usage by analyzing Event ID 4769 for RC4 encryption type (0x17) in environments enforcing AES, identifying tickets with abnormal lifetimes exceeding domain policy, correlating TGS requests with missing corresponding TGT requests (Event ID 4768), and detecting krbtgt password age anomalies.


## When to Use

- When investigating security incidents that require detecting golden ticket forgery
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Prerequisites

- Windows Domain Controller with Kerberos audit logging enabled
- Splunk or Elastic SIEM ingesting Windows Security event logs
- Python 3.8+ for offline event log analysis
- Knowledge of domain Kerberos encryption policy (AES vs RC4)

## Steps

1. Audit domain Kerberos encryption policy to establish AES-only baseline
2. Forward Event IDs 4768 and 4769 to SIEM platform
3. Detect RC4 (0x17) encryption in TGS requests where AES is enforced
4. Identify TGS requests without corresponding TGT requests (forged ticket indicator)
5. Alert on ticket lifetimes exceeding MaxTicketAge domain policy
6. Monitor krbtgt account password age and last reset date
7. Correlate findings with host/user context for risk scoring

## Expected Output

JSON report with Golden Ticket indicators including RC4 downgrades, orphaned TGS requests, abnormal ticket lifetimes, and risk-scored alerts with MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping.

## Self-correction

- If a SIFT tool errors, read `describe_sift_tool` and pick an alternate from the tool map.
- If procedure steps require SIEM/cloud/live APIs, log `{journal_id}` + `action=deferred` with the gap.
- Do not override `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Mark inference vs confirmed in journal; tie confirmed findings to `audit_id`.

## Limits

- Playbooks guide reasoning; **confirmed findings require tool output** in scratch with matching `audit_id`.
- Reference-mode steps are not executable on cold-box until equivalent SIFT tooling exists.
