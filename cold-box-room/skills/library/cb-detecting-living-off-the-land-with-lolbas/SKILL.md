# Detecting Living Off The Land With Lolbas (cold-box)

> **Journal ID:** `CB-SKL-025` — cite this in every journal entry while following this playbook.

## Cold-box constraints (always)

- Evidence lives on the **sealed operation table** — read only through the viewport (`input_relpath`).
- **Never write** on `operation-table/`; tool output goes to `records/{case_id}/scratch/`.
- **Log this playbook** in the case journal with **`CB-SKL-025`** (`log_skill`) when you adopt it and at each major step.
- Every SIFT execution: `run_sift_tool` with **`purpose`**, **`why`**, and cite returned **`tool_id`** + **`audit_id`** in the journal.
- Prefer `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` — skip `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Load this playbook with `get_skill("cb-detecting-living-off-the-land-with-lolbas")`; do not treat markdown code blocks as direct shell commands.

## Agent loop

1. `suggest_skills(case_profile=...)` or `get_skill("cb-detecting-living-off-the-land-with-lolbas")` → note **`CB-SKL-025`**
2. `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="CB-SKL-025", action="adopted", note="...")`
3. `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` → pick tools from the map below
4. `describe_sift_tool(tool_id)` → `run_sift_tool(...)` → journal stdout with `CB-SKL-025` + `audit_id`
5. `log_skill(..., action="finding", note="...")` when recording conclusions; self-correct if outputs conflict


## When to use

- When investigating security incidents that require detecting living off the land with lolbas
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Tool map (SIFT via MCP)

**Execution mode:** `sift_runnable` — SIFT tools below are available on this host.

| binary | tool_id | verified | available |
|--------|---------|----------|-----------|
| `regsvr32` | `SIFT-100` | no | yes |
| `wmic` | `SIFT-186` | no | no |

## Cold-box MCP examples

Use these instead of running shell blocks directly. Always log `{journal_id}` in purpose/why or via `log_skill`.

### `regsvr32` → `SIFT-100`

```json
{
  "tool_id": "SIFT-100",
  "case_id": "{case_id}",
  "input_relpath": "{artifact_relpath}",
  "purpose": "[CB-SKL-025] regsvr32 per playbook step",
  "why": "Executing cb-detecting-living-off-the-land-with-lolbas \u2014 see Procedure section",
  "extra_args": []
}
```

### `wmic` → `SIFT-186`

```json
{
  "tool_id": "SIFT-186",
  "case_id": "{case_id}",
  "input_relpath": "{artifact_relpath}",
  "purpose": "[CB-SKL-025] wmic per playbook step",
  "why": "Executing cb-detecting-living-off-the-land-with-lolbas \u2014 see Procedure section",
  "extra_args": []
}
```

## Journal logging

When you adopt this playbook, append to `records/{case_id}/{case_id}.md`:

```markdown
## {timestamp} — skill `CB-SKL-025` (`cb-detecting-living-off-the-land-with-lolbas`)

- **action:** adopted | step | finding | deferred | completed
- **note:** What you did or concluded under this playbook
- **related_audit_ids:** (optional) CB-… from run_sift_tool
```

Or call MCP: `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="{journal_id}", action="adopted", note="...")`

## Cold-box path translation

When the procedure below uses host paths, translate as follows:

| Procedure path | Cold-box equivalent |
|----------------|---------------------|
| `C:\Evidence\...` / `/cases/...` | `{input_relpath}` on the sealed table (via viewport) |
| `C:\Output\...` / `/analysis/...` | `records/{case_id}/scratch/` (tool stdout/files) |
| Live SIEM / cloud console steps | **Reference only** on cold-box — note capability gap in journal |

Do not copy evidence off the table except into `records/{case_id}/scratch/` via `run_sift_tool`.


## Procedure

## Overview

Living Off the Land Binaries, Scripts, and Libraries (LOLBAS) are legitimate system utilities abused by attackers to execute malicious actions while evading detection. This skill covers detecting abuse of certutil.exe, regsvr32.exe, mshta.exe, rundll32.exe, msbuild.exe, and other LOLBins using process telemetry from Sysmon and Windows Event Logs, combined with Sigma rule-based detection.


## When to Use

- When investigating security incidents that require detecting living off the land with lolbas
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Prerequisites

- Sysmon or Windows Security Event Log (Event ID 4688) with command-line logging enabled
- Sigma rule conversion tool (sigmac or sigma-cli)
- SIEM platform (Splunk, Elastic, or similar) for log ingestion
- Python 3.8+ with pySigma library
- LOLBAS project reference database

## Steps

1. **Establish LOLBin Watchlist** — Build a prioritized list of monitored binaries (certutil, mshta, regsvr32, rundll32, msbuild, installutil, cmstp, wmic, bitsadmin)
2. **Collect Process Telemetry** — Ingest Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Create) and Windows 4688 events with full command-line capture
3. **Build Sigma Detection Rules** — Create Sigma rules matching suspicious command-line arguments, network activity, and parent-child process anomalies for each LOLBin
4. **Analyze Parent-Child Relationships** — Flag unexpected parent processes spawning LOLBins (e.g., Excel spawning certutil, Word spawning mshta)
5. **Score and Prioritize Alerts** — Apply risk scoring based on argument anomaly, parent process, execution path, and network indicators
6. **Generate Detection Report** — Produce a structured report of all LOLBin abuse detections with MITRE ATT&CK mapping

## Expected Output

- JSON report listing detected LOLBin abuse events with severity scores
- MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping for each detection (T1218, T1105, T1140, T1127)
- Parent-child process anomaly analysis
- Sigma rule match details with raw event data

## Self-correction

- If a SIFT tool errors, read `describe_sift_tool` and pick an alternate from the tool map.
- If procedure steps require SIEM/cloud/live APIs, log `{journal_id}` + `action=deferred` with the gap.
- Do not override `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Mark inference vs confirmed in journal; tie confirmed findings to `audit_id`.

## Limits

- Playbooks guide reasoning; **confirmed findings require tool output** in scratch with matching `audit_id`.
- Reference-mode steps are not executable on cold-box until equivalent SIFT tooling exists.
