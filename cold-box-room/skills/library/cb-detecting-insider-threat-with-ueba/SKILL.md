# Detecting Insider Threat With Ueba (cold-box)

> **Journal ID:** `CB-SKL-192` — cite this in every journal entry while following this playbook.

## Cold-box constraints (always)

- Evidence lives on the **sealed operation table** — read only through the viewport (`input_relpath`).
- **Never write** on `operation-table/`; tool output goes to `records/{case_id}/scratch/`.
- **Log this playbook** in the case journal with **`CB-SKL-192`** (`log_skill`) when you adopt it and at each major step.
- Every SIFT execution: `run_sift_tool` with **`purpose`**, **`why`**, and cite returned **`tool_id`** + **`audit_id`** in the journal.
- Prefer `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` — skip `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Load this playbook with `get_skill("cb-detecting-insider-threat-with-ueba")`; do not treat markdown code blocks as direct shell commands.

## Agent loop

1. `suggest_skills(case_profile=...)` or `get_skill("cb-detecting-insider-threat-with-ueba")` → note **`CB-SKL-192`**
2. `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="CB-SKL-192", action="adopted", note="...")`
3. `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` → pick tools from the map below
4. `describe_sift_tool(tool_id)` → `run_sift_tool(...)` → journal stdout with `CB-SKL-192` + `audit_id`
5. `log_skill(..., action="finding", note="...")` when recording conclusions; self-correct if outputs conflict


## When to use

- When investigating security incidents that require detecting insider threat with ueba
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Tool map (SIFT via MCP)

**Execution mode:** `sift_runnable` — SIFT tools below are available on this host.

| binary | tool_id | verified | available |
|--------|---------|----------|-----------|
| `file` | `SIFT-008` | yes | yes |

## Cold-box MCP examples

Use these instead of running shell blocks directly. Always log `{journal_id}` in purpose/why or via `log_skill`.

### `file` → `SIFT-008`

```json
{
  "tool_id": "SIFT-008",
  "case_id": "{case_id}",
  "input_relpath": "{artifact_relpath}",
  "purpose": "[CB-SKL-192] file per playbook step",
  "why": "Executing cb-detecting-insider-threat-with-ueba \u2014 see Procedure section",
  "extra_args": []
}
```

## Journal logging

When you adopt this playbook, append to `records/{case_id}/{case_id}.md`:

```markdown
## {timestamp} — skill `CB-SKL-192` (`cb-detecting-insider-threat-with-ueba`)

- **action:** adopted | step | finding | deferred | completed
- **note:** What you did or concluded under this playbook
- **related_audit_ids:** (optional) CB-… from run_sift_tool
```

Or call MCP: `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="{journal_id}", action="adopted", note="...")`

## Cold-box path translation

When the procedure below uses host paths, translate as follows:

| Procedure path | Cold-box equivalent |
|----------------|---------------------|
| `C:\Evidence\...` / `/cases/...` | `{input_relpath}` on the sealed table (via viewport) |
| `C:\Output\...` / `/analysis/...` | `records/{case_id}/scratch/` (tool stdout/files) |
| Live SIEM / cloud console steps | **Reference only** on cold-box — note capability gap in journal |

Do not copy evidence off the table except into `records/{case_id}/scratch/` via `run_sift_tool`.


## Procedure

## Overview

User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) moves beyond static rule-based detection to model normal behavior for users, hosts, and applications, then flag statistically significant deviations that may indicate insider threats. Using Elasticsearch as the analytics backend, this skill covers building behavioral baselines from authentication logs, file access events, and network activity, computing risk scores using statistical deviation and peer group comparison, and correlating multiple low-confidence indicators into high-confidence insider threat alerts.


## When to Use

- When investigating security incidents that require detecting insider threat with ueba
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Prerequisites

- Elasticsearch 8.x or OpenSearch 2.x cluster with security audit data
- Log sources: Active Directory authentication, VPN, DLP, file server access, email
- Python 3.9+ with elasticsearch client library
- Baseline period of 30+ days of normal user activity data
- Defined peer groups based on department, role, or job function

## Steps

### Step 1: Ingest and Normalize Activity Logs
Configure log pipelines to ingest authentication, file access, email, and network logs into Elasticsearch with a unified user identity field.

### Step 2: Build Behavioral Baselines
Calculate per-user baselines for login times, data volume, application usage, and access patterns over a rolling 30-day window using Elasticsearch aggregations.

### Step 3: Calculate Anomaly Scores
Compare current activity against baselines using z-score deviation and peer group comparison to generate per-user risk scores.

### Step 4: Correlate and Alert
Combine multiple anomalous indicators (unusual hours + large downloads + new system access) into composite risk scores that trigger SOC investigation workflows.

## Expected Output

JSON report containing per-user risk scores, anomalous activity details, peer group deviations, and recommended investigation actions.

## Self-correction

- If a SIFT tool errors, read `describe_sift_tool` and pick an alternate from the tool map.
- If procedure steps require SIEM/cloud/live APIs, log `{journal_id}` + `action=deferred` with the gap.
- Do not override `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Mark inference vs confirmed in journal; tie confirmed findings to `audit_id`.

## Limits

- Playbooks guide reasoning; **confirmed findings require tool output** in scratch with matching `audit_id`.
- Reference-mode steps are not executable on cold-box until equivalent SIFT tooling exists.
