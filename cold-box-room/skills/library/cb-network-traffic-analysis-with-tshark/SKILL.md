# Network Traffic Analysis With Tshark (cold-box)

> **Journal ID:** `CB-SKL-093` — cite this in every journal entry while following this playbook.

## Cold-box constraints (always)

- Evidence lives on the **sealed operation table** — read only through the viewport (`input_relpath`).
- **Never write** on `operation-table/`; tool output goes to `records/{case_id}/scratch/`.
- **Log this playbook** in the case journal with **`CB-SKL-093`** (`log_skill`) when you adopt it and at each major step.
- Every SIFT execution: `run_sift_tool` with **`purpose`**, **`why`**, and cite returned **`tool_id`** + **`audit_id`** in the journal.
- Prefer `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` — skip `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Load this playbook with `get_skill("cb-network-traffic-analysis-with-tshark")`; do not treat markdown code blocks as direct shell commands.

## Agent loop

1. `suggest_skills(case_profile=...)` or `get_skill("cb-network-traffic-analysis-with-tshark")` → note **`CB-SKL-093`**
2. `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="CB-SKL-093", action="adopted", note="...")`
3. `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` → pick tools from the map below
4. `describe_sift_tool(tool_id)` → `run_sift_tool(...)` → journal stdout with `CB-SKL-093` + `audit_id`
5. `log_skill(..., action="finding", note="...")` when recording conclusions; self-correct if outputs conflict


## When to use

- When conducting security assessments that involve performing network traffic analysis with tshark
- When following incident response procedures for related security events
- When performing scheduled security testing or auditing activities
- When validating security controls through hands-on testing

## Tool map (SIFT via MCP)

**Execution mode:** `sift_runnable` — SIFT tools below are available on this host.

| binary | tool_id | verified | available |
|--------|---------|----------|-----------|
| `wireshark` | `SIFT-118` | no | yes |
| `tshark` | `SIFT-117` | no | no |
| `file` | `SIFT-008` | yes | yes |

## Cold-box MCP examples

Use these instead of running shell blocks directly. Always log `{journal_id}` in purpose/why or via `log_skill`.

### `wireshark` → `SIFT-118`

```json
{
  "tool_id": "SIFT-118",
  "case_id": "{case_id}",
  "input_relpath": "{artifact_relpath}",
  "purpose": "[CB-SKL-093] wireshark per playbook step",
  "why": "Executing cb-network-traffic-analysis-with-tshark \u2014 see Procedure section",
  "extra_args": []
}
```

### `tshark` → `SIFT-117`

```json
{
  "tool_id": "SIFT-117",
  "case_id": "{case_id}",
  "input_relpath": "{artifact_relpath}",
  "purpose": "[CB-SKL-093] tshark per playbook step",
  "why": "Executing cb-network-traffic-analysis-with-tshark \u2014 see Procedure section",
  "extra_args": []
}
```

### `file` → `SIFT-008`

```json
{
  "tool_id": "SIFT-008",
  "case_id": "{case_id}",
  "input_relpath": "{artifact_relpath}",
  "purpose": "[CB-SKL-093] file per playbook step",
  "why": "Executing cb-network-traffic-analysis-with-tshark \u2014 see Procedure section",
  "extra_args": []
}
```

## Journal logging

When you adopt this playbook, append to `records/{case_id}/{case_id}.md`:

```markdown
## {timestamp} — skill `CB-SKL-093` (`cb-network-traffic-analysis-with-tshark`)

- **action:** adopted | step | finding | deferred | completed
- **note:** What you did or concluded under this playbook
- **related_audit_ids:** (optional) CB-… from run_sift_tool
```

Or call MCP: `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="{journal_id}", action="adopted", note="...")`

## Cold-box path translation

When the procedure below uses host paths, translate as follows:

| Procedure path | Cold-box equivalent |
|----------------|---------------------|
| `C:\Evidence\...` / `/cases/...` | `{input_relpath}` on the sealed table (via viewport) |
| `C:\Output\...` / `/analysis/...` | `records/{case_id}/scratch/` (tool stdout/files) |
| Live SIEM / cloud console steps | **Reference only** on cold-box — note capability gap in journal |

Do not copy evidence off the table except into `records/{case_id}/scratch/` via `run_sift_tool`.


## Procedure

## Overview

This skill automates packet capture analysis using tshark (Wireshark CLI) and pyshark (Python wrapper). It extracts protocol distribution statistics, identifies suspicious network flows (port scans, beaconing, data exfiltration), extracts IOCs (IPs, domains, URLs), and detects DNS tunneling patterns from PCAP files.


## When to Use

- When conducting security assessments that involve performing network traffic analysis with tshark
- When following incident response procedures for related security events
- When performing scheduled security testing or auditing activities
- When validating security controls through hands-on testing

## Prerequisites

- tshark (Wireshark CLI) installed and in PATH
- Python 3.8+ with pyshark library
- PCAP or PCAPNG capture file for analysis

## Steps

1. **Extract Protocol Statistics** — Generate protocol hierarchy and conversation statistics from the capture
2. **Identify Top Talkers** — Rank source/destination IPs by volume and connection count
3. **Detect Suspicious Flows** — Flag port scanning patterns, unusual port usage, and high-frequency connections
4. **Extract Network IOCs** — Pull unique IPs, domains from DNS queries, and URLs from HTTP traffic
5. **Analyze DNS Traffic** — Detect DNS tunneling via high-entropy subdomain queries and excessive TXT records
6. **Generate Analysis Report** — Produce structured report with flow summaries and threat indicators

## Expected Output

- JSON report with protocol statistics and top talkers
- Suspicious flow detections with severity ratings
- Extracted IOCs (IPs, domains, URLs)
- DNS anomaly analysis results

## Self-correction

- If a SIFT tool errors, read `describe_sift_tool` and pick an alternate from the tool map.
- If procedure steps require SIEM/cloud/live APIs, log `{journal_id}` + `action=deferred` with the gap.
- Do not override `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Mark inference vs confirmed in journal; tie confirmed findings to `audit_id`.

## Limits

- Playbooks guide reasoning; **confirmed findings require tool output** in scratch with matching `audit_id`.
- Reference-mode steps are not executable on cold-box until equivalent SIFT tooling exists.
