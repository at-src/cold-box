# Threat Intelligence Sharing With Misp (cold-box)

> **Journal ID:** `CB-SKL-331` — cite this in every journal entry while following this playbook.

## Cold-box constraints (always)

- Evidence lives on the **sealed operation table** — read only through the viewport (`input_relpath`).
- **Never write** on `operation-table/`; tool output goes to `records/{case_id}/scratch/`.
- **Log this playbook** in the case journal with **`CB-SKL-331`** (`log_skill`) when you adopt it and at each major step.
- Every SIFT execution: `run_sift_tool` with **`purpose`**, **`why`**, and cite returned **`tool_id`** + **`audit_id`** in the journal.
- Prefer `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` — skip `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Load this playbook with `get_skill("cb-threat-intelligence-sharing-with-misp")`; do not treat markdown code blocks as direct shell commands.

## Agent loop

1. `suggest_skills(case_profile=...)` or `get_skill("cb-threat-intelligence-sharing-with-misp")` → note **`CB-SKL-331`**
2. `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="CB-SKL-331", action="adopted", note="...")`
3. `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` → pick tools from the map below
4. `describe_sift_tool(tool_id)` → `run_sift_tool(...)` → journal stdout with `CB-SKL-331` + `audit_id`
5. `log_skill(..., action="finding", note="...")` when recording conclusions; self-correct if outputs conflict


## When to use

- When conducting security assessments that involve performing threat intelligence sharing with misp
- When following incident response procedures for related security events
- When performing scheduled security testing or auditing activities
- When validating security controls through hands-on testing

## Tool map (SIFT via MCP)

**Execution mode:** `sift_runnable` — SIFT tools below are available on this host.

| binary | tool_id | verified | available |
|--------|---------|----------|-----------|
| `file` | `SIFT-008` | yes | yes |

## Cold-box MCP examples

Use these instead of running shell blocks directly. Always log `{journal_id}` in purpose/why or via `log_skill`.

### `file` → `SIFT-008`

```json
{
  "tool_id": "SIFT-008",
  "case_id": "{case_id}",
  "input_relpath": "{artifact_relpath}",
  "purpose": "[CB-SKL-331] file per playbook step",
  "why": "Executing cb-threat-intelligence-sharing-with-misp \u2014 see Procedure section",
  "extra_args": []
}
```

## Journal logging

When you adopt this playbook, append to `records/{case_id}/{case_id}.md`:

```markdown
## {timestamp} — skill `CB-SKL-331` (`cb-threat-intelligence-sharing-with-misp`)

- **action:** adopted | step | finding | deferred | completed
- **note:** What you did or concluded under this playbook
- **related_audit_ids:** (optional) CB-… from run_sift_tool
```

Or call MCP: `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="{journal_id}", action="adopted", note="...")`

## Cold-box path translation

When the procedure below uses host paths, translate as follows:

| Procedure path | Cold-box equivalent |
|----------------|---------------------|
| `C:\Evidence\...` / `/cases/...` | `{input_relpath}` on the sealed table (via viewport) |
| `C:\Output\...` / `/analysis/...` | `records/{case_id}/scratch/` (tool stdout/files) |
| Live SIEM / cloud console steps | **Reference only** on cold-box — note capability gap in journal |

Do not copy evidence off the table except into `records/{case_id}/scratch/` via `run_sift_tool`.


## Procedure

## Overview

MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) is an open-source threat intelligence platform designed for collecting, storing, distributing, and sharing cybersecurity indicators and threat information. PyMISP is the official Python library for interacting with MISP instances via the REST API, enabling programmatic event creation, attribute management, tag assignment, galaxy cluster attachment, and feed synchronization. This skill covers using PyMISP to create events with structured IOCs (IP addresses, domains, file hashes, URLs), enrich events with MITRE ATT&CK tags, manage sharing groups and distribution levels, search for existing intelligence, and export in STIX 2.1 format for interoperability with other platforms.


## When to Use

- When conducting security assessments that involve performing threat intelligence sharing with misp
- When following incident response procedures for related security events
- When performing scheduled security testing or auditing activities
- When validating security controls through hands-on testing

## Prerequisites

- MISP instance (v2.4+) with API access enabled
- Python 3.9+ with `pymisp` (`pip install pymisp`)
- MISP API key (Settings > Auth Keys)
- Understanding of MISP data model (Events, Attributes, Objects, Tags, Galaxies)
- Knowledge of TLP marking and sharing protocols

## Steps

1. Install PyMISP: `pip install pymisp`
2. Initialize `ExpandedPyMISP(url, key, ssl=True)` connection
3. Create a `MISPEvent` with info, distribution level, threat level, and analysis status
4. Add attributes via `event.add_attribute(type, value)` for IPs, domains, hashes
5. Apply TLP tags and MITRE ATT&CK technique tags
6. Publish the event with `misp.publish(event)`
7. Search existing events with `misp.search(controller='events', value=..., type_attribute=...)`
8. Enable and configure threat feeds for automatic IOC ingestion
9. Export events in STIX 2.1 format for cross-platform sharing
10. Validate sharing group configuration and sync server settings

## Expected Output

A JSON report summarizing events created, attributes added, tags applied, feed sync status, and any correlation hits against existing intelligence, with event IDs and distribution metadata.

## Self-correction

- If a SIFT tool errors, read `describe_sift_tool` and pick an alternate from the tool map.
- If procedure steps require SIEM/cloud/live APIs, log `{journal_id}` + `action=deferred` with the gap.
- Do not override `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Mark inference vs confirmed in journal; tie confirmed findings to `audit_id`.

## Limits

- Playbooks guide reasoning; **confirmed findings require tool output** in scratch with matching `audit_id`.
- Reference-mode steps are not executable on cold-box until equivalent SIFT tooling exists.
