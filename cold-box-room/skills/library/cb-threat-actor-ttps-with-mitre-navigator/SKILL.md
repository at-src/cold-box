# Threat Actor Ttps With Mitre Navigator (cold-box)

> **Journal ID:** `CB-SKL-329` — cite this in every journal entry while following this playbook.

## Cold-box constraints (always)

- Evidence lives on the **sealed operation table** — read only through the viewport (`input_relpath`).
- **Never write** on `operation-table/`; tool output goes to `records/{case_id}/scratch/`.
- **Log this playbook** in the case journal with **`CB-SKL-329`** (`log_skill`) when you adopt it and at each major step.
- Every SIFT execution: `run_sift_tool` with **`purpose`**, **`why`**, and cite returned **`tool_id`** + **`audit_id`** in the journal.
- Prefer `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` — skip `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Load this playbook with `get_skill("cb-threat-actor-ttps-with-mitre-navigator")`; do not treat markdown code blocks as direct shell commands.

## Agent loop

1. `suggest_skills(case_profile=...)` or `get_skill("cb-threat-actor-ttps-with-mitre-navigator")` → note **`CB-SKL-329`**
2. `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="CB-SKL-329", action="adopted", note="...")`
3. `list_sift_tools(verified_only=true)` → pick tools from the map below
4. `describe_sift_tool(tool_id)` → `run_sift_tool(...)` → journal stdout with `CB-SKL-329` + `audit_id`
5. `log_skill(..., action="finding", note="...")` when recording conclusions; self-correct if outputs conflict


## When to use

- When investigating security incidents that require analyzing threat actor ttps with mitre navigator
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Tool map (SIFT via MCP)

**Execution mode:** `reference` — Limited SIFT coverage; treat remaining steps as reference.

| binary | tool_id | verified | available |
|--------|---------|----------|-----------|
| `powershell` | `SIFT-179` | no | no |

## Cold-box MCP examples

Use these instead of running shell blocks directly. Always log `{journal_id}` in purpose/why or via `log_skill`.

### `powershell` → `SIFT-179`

```json
{
  "tool_id": "SIFT-179",
  "case_id": "{case_id}",
  "input_relpath": "{artifact_relpath}",
  "purpose": "[CB-SKL-329] powershell per playbook step",
  "why": "Executing cb-threat-actor-ttps-with-mitre-navigator \u2014 see Procedure section",
  "extra_args": []
}
```

## Journal logging

When you adopt this playbook, append to `records/{case_id}/{case_id}.md`:

```markdown
## {timestamp} — skill `CB-SKL-329` (`cb-threat-actor-ttps-with-mitre-navigator`)

- **action:** adopted | step | finding | deferred | completed
- **note:** What you did or concluded under this playbook
- **related_audit_ids:** (optional) CB-… from run_sift_tool
```

Or call MCP: `log_skill(case_id, journal_id="{journal_id}", action="adopted", note="...")`

## Cold-box path translation

When the procedure below uses host paths, translate as follows:

| Procedure path | Cold-box equivalent |
|----------------|---------------------|
| `C:\Evidence\...` / `/cases/...` | `{input_relpath}` on the sealed table (via viewport) |
| `C:\Output\...` / `/analysis/...` | `records/{case_id}/scratch/` (tool stdout/files) |
| Live SIEM / cloud console steps | **Reference only** on cold-box — note capability gap in journal |

Do not copy evidence off the table except into `records/{case_id}/scratch/` via `run_sift_tool`.


## Procedure

## Overview

The MITRE ATT&CK Navigator is a web application for annotating and visualizing ATT&CK matrices.
Combined with the attackcti Python library (which queries ATT&CK STIX data via TAXII), analysts
can programmatically generate Navigator layer files mapping specific threat group TTPs, compare
multiple groups, and assess detection coverage gaps against known adversaries.


## When to Use

- When investigating security incidents that require analyzing threat actor ttps with mitre navigator
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ with attackcti and stix2 libraries installed
- MITRE ATT&CK Navigator (web UI or local instance)
- Understanding of STIX 2.1 objects and relationships

## Steps

1. Query ATT&CK STIX data for target threat group using attackcti
2. Extract techniques associated with the group via STIX relationships
3. Generate ATT&CK Navigator layer JSON with technique annotations
4. Overlay detection coverage to identify gaps
5. Export layer for team review and defensive planning

## Expected Output

```json
{
  "name": "APT29 TTPs",
  "domain": "enterprise-attack",
  "techniques": [
    {"techniqueID": "T1566.001", "score": 1, "comment": "Spearphishing Attachment"},
    {"techniqueID": "T1059.001", "score": 1, "comment": "PowerShell"}
  ]
}
```

## Self-correction

- If a SIFT tool errors, read `describe_sift_tool` and pick an alternate from the tool map.
- If procedure steps require SIEM/cloud/live APIs, log `{journal_id}` + `action=deferred` with the gap.
- Do not override `[BAD — DO NOT USE]` tools.
- Mark inference vs confirmed in journal; tie confirmed findings to `audit_id`.

## Limits

- Playbooks guide reasoning; **confirmed findings require tool output** in scratch with matching `audit_id`.
- Reference-mode steps are not executable on cold-box until equivalent SIFT tooling exists.
